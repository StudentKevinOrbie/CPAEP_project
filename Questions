Question 1:
What about overflow in the mac ?
It is assumed to be ok

Question 2:
out = mac_out (16-bits = 32-bits) ?
Uses the LSB

Question 3:
Why not add signed to top_chip input ? Ln 27
Focus not on arithmatic, as long as golden version same nice!

=================================
We could add +3 kernel to reduce BW req
Add ++regs to pipeline (multiplier = adder time) due to 2x size ==> Fclk/2

TODO:
- Control
- top_chip --> OK
- Driver and Monitor
- Testing
- Do registers in ODS --> OK
- Fifo log2, use Ceil ! --> OK
